/**
 * @file qcrypto_dyn.h
 * @brief QNX cryptography library dynamic API
 *
 * This shim library is designed to allow client code to compile @c qcrypto library
 * support without explicitly linking in the library itself.
 * Instead, programs only need to link to @c libqcrypto_dyn.so.
 *
 * When @e qcrypto_load() is called, the library is opened via @e dlopen() and provides
 * an interface identical to the regular @c qcrypto library API.
