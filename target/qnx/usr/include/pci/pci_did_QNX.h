 Assigned Device ID's for vendor PCI_VID_BlackBerry_QNX (0x1C05)

 **IMPORTANT**

 This file is the single point of control for Device ID assignments of QNX
 implemented devices. Since it is a public header, these assignments cannot
 be changed after they have been released

 The file 'pcidatabase.com-tab_delimited.txt' (and any future variants supported
 by the strings module), simply provides a mapping of a given vendors devices
 to a textual description meant for human consumption and IS NOT the
 aforementioned point of control

 If you add a new Device ID to this file, please also add a concise description
 to the relevant database files in the strings module
 Search for "QNX"
