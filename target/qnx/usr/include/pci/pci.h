 the default location is used (see PCI_CAP_MODULE_DIR_DEFAULT). Although this
 environment variable can be individually set for different processes, mixing
 and matching modules is not generally desirable.

 Example configuration files can be found in /etc/system/config/pci/
*/
#define PCI_ENVVAR_HW_CONFIG		"PCI_HW_CONFIG_FILE"

 PCI_ENVVAR_VERBOSITY [optional]

 This define specifies the name of the environment variable which contains the
 base verbosity level for PCI server related logging. This optional environment
 variable allows the verbosity level to be specified without having to recompile
 any code which utilizes the PCI server library and modules. It is particularly
 relevant to the backwards compatibility module to obtain slogger entries for
 driver software which has not yet been ported to the new PCI server APIs
 and/or which doesn't currently manipulate the 'pci_verbosity' variable under
 command line control.

 The value given to this environment variable should be an unsigned integer and
 specifies the base verbosity level (which by default is 0). For programs
 which do not manipulate the 'pci_verbosity' variable (like driver software
 which uses the pci_bkwd_compat.so module) the value behaves the same as
 incrementing the verbosity parameter by the value of the PCI_BASE_VERBOSITY
 environment variable. For programs which do manipulate the 'pci_verbosity'
 variable, this base level changes the default from 0 to the specified value and
 any command line options to increase 'pci_verbosity' will increase it from the
 base value set in the environment variable

 PCI_ENVVAR_PCI_SERVER_BUSCFG_MODULE [optional]

 This define specifies the name of the environment variable which contains the
 name of the optional bus configuration module for the PCI server. This variable
 is optional and is only required if the PCI server will configure the PCI bus
 (ie. assign secondary/subordinate bus numbers to bridges, (re)calculate address
 spaces requirements and assign them to devices by updating BAR registers, etc).
 If the PCI server will only be enumerating an existing configuration, a bus
 configuration module will not be required and the environment variable will be
 ignored.

 If a configuration will be performed, this environment variable is still
 optional and the generic module identified by PCI_SERVER_BUSCFG_MODULE_DEFAULT
 will be used by default. The PCI_ENVVAR_PCI_SERVER_BUSCFG_MODULE environment

/*
 PCI_ENVVAR_PCI_MODULE_BLACKLIST [optional]

 This define specifies the name of the environment variable which contains the
 list of modules which are black listed and will not be used. The blacklist is
 checked at the point that a module load is attempted. Once a module has been
 successfully loaded, the blacklist will no longer be consulted for that module
 so it is important that the blacklist is created before a module is loaded for
 the first time.

 While generally applicable to any PCI module, its main purpose is to control
 the use of capability modules without modifying the driver software itself.
 For example, a driver written to make use of MSI-X and MSI's (preferentially
 in that order) could be started with the MSI-X capability module blacklisted
 so that it will defer to using MSI's without changing software or requiring a
 command line option to the driver.

 Because this is an environment variable, this control can be provided on a per
 driver basis however note that when this environment variable is specified for
 the PCI server, the effect is more global in nature. Any blacklisted capability
 modules in the server environment will actually prevent their use for all
 driver software regardless of the setting of the variable in that drivers
 environment. Drivers will still be able to read the device capabilities but
 will not be able to enable them and hence not use them

 If multiple modules will be blacklisted they can be separated with a colon (:)

 Modules can be specified as a simple name or with a leading '/'. If a simple
 name is used, the module must exist in the "/lib/dll/pci/" directory. If the
 first character of the name is '/', the name must specify the full path to the
 module. Only an exact pathname match will prevent the loading of a module. This
 should be kept in mind if the capability module directory has been altered
 with the PCI_CAP_MODULE_DIR environment variable

 NOTE

 Because a vid/did specific capability module is always checked for before a
 generic capability module, if you are using a vid/did specific capability
 module and wish to prevent the use of that capability, both the vid/did
 specific and the generic modules should be blacklisted
*/
#define PCI_ENVVAR_PCI_MODULE_BLACKLIST		"PCI_MODULE_BLACKLIST"

/*
 PCI_ENVVAR_PCI_PARTITION_NAME [optional]

 This define specifies the name of the environment variable which contains the
 partition name when PCI Hierarchy Partitioning and Segmentation functionality
 will be used to divide a PCI domain into separate partitions. By default, the
 entire domain is associated with the default partition identified by
 PCI_SERVER_PARTITION_NAME_DEFAULT

 The rules for partition names requires that there be no '/' characters. The
 length of the name, while ultimately constrained to PATH_MAX (less approximately
 20 characters or so) should be kept to a minimum and preferably reflect the
 rationale for the partitions' existence

 Note: a client process can only be associated with one partition and once
       associated with a partition (triggered by libpci API calls), the calling
       process retains the association until it terminates. That is, changing
       the environment variable value within a client program will not change
       the partition the client program is associated with, once that association
       is established. The pci_partition_name() API can be used to determine
       which partition a client process is associated with

 See also the "PCI Hierarchy Partitioning and Segmentation" documentation for
 more information and examples

 Base type which encodes a Chassis/Slot number which uniquely identifies which
 slot in which chassis a device resides.

 The encoding is as follows

	cccs ssss ssss ssss

 Encoding/Decoding of the 'pci_cs_t' is accomplished with the PCI_CS*() macros

 There is a maximum of 32 slots per chassis as defined by the Slot
 Identification capability however there are 13 bits for slot numbers to
 accommodate the size of the 'physical slot number' field in the slot
 capabilities register of PCIe root ports. Choosing an 16 bit data type for
 'pci_cs_t' permits up to 8 chassis' (7 expansion chassis').

 Slot numbers start at 1. If PCI_SLOT() == 0, it means that the device is not
 in a slot.

 As far a chassis numbers go, even if there is no chassis based bridges in the
 system, a chassis number of 0 will exist. That is, a board with PCI devices on
 it (perhaps including slots) will logically reside in a chassis 0

	 *	  a successful detach call until all attaches are matched with a detach (ie.
	 *	  PCI_ERR_EAGAIN can be treated as OK when this mechanism is enabled). The last
	 *	  successful detach will return PCI_ERR_OK to indicate that the client has
	 *	  successfully detached from the server. Any other error should be treated as a

	 *	  See also point 2 following
	 *	  In addition, if PCI_BASE_VERBOSITY is >= 4 and PCI_DEBUG_MODULE is set,
	 *	  then attach count tracking will be logged
	 *
	 * 2. there are asynchronous disconnection scenarios which may result in premature
	 *	  disconnection from the server resulting in PCI_ERR_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE
	 *	  errors being returned from API calls including pci_device_detach().
	 *	  In this case, once the disconnection occurs, whether temporary or not, the
	 *	  synchronous disconnect functionality enabled by this flag will be immediately
	 *	  disabled. No further pci_device_detach() calls are required to disconnect

 A Reset type < pci_resetType_e_BUS is considered to be no reset (no-op)
 A Reset type >= pci_resetType_e_hw_specific_first is considered to be a HW
 specific reset

 With the exception of Reset type pci_resetType_e_SEGMENT, the behaviour of
 HW specific resets, if supported, are defined by the HW dependent module.
 Refer to the release notes or 'use' information in the HW dependent module
 applicable to your platform for details

 A Reset type of pci_resetType_e_SEGMENT is considered to be a predefined HW
 specific reset and if used, must be issued on a PCIe Root Port device type
 otherwise an error will be returned
 This reset behaves similar to a BUS reset wrt the reconfiguration of devices
 below the Root Port. That is, all devices below the Root Port will be returned
 to their D0 initialized state similar to the case of a BUS reset issued on the
 downstream link of a Root Port however the Root Port itself will also be
 reconfigured to the D0 initialized state. The primary difference with this
 reset type is that it is the responsibility of the HW module to actually
 perform the Root Port reset in a hardware specific fashion. If the HW module
 does not support this reset type, PCI_ERR_ENOTSUP will be returned

 _pci_resetPhase_e

 Currently defined HW reset phases for BUS and FUNCTION Level resets

 Phase 1 - just prior to issuing the reset. This means prior to toggling bit
		   6 in the BCTRL register of a bridge device or of setting the
		   appropriate FLR bit in either the PCIe or AF capability.
		   All required devices have entered hold off and no transactions are
		   pending. The command register bus master bit has been cleared and
		   the interrupt disable bit has been set

 Phase 2 - immediately after issuing the reset (as per above) and after the
		   bus/link has returned active

 Phase 3 - just prior to releasing all applicable device hold offs

 UNSPECIFIED - this is the value used for a reset type other than BUS or
			   FUNCTION. The reset message handler will call directly into the
			   HW module to perform the reset. At the time of the call, all
			   device activity will have been halted (similar to the end of a
			   phase 1 call) and upon return, all hold offs will be removed
			   (similar to the end of a phase 3 call) however there is only one
			   call into the HW dependent module and so the phase is unspecified
			   If PCI_ERR_OK is returned, the device will be reconfigured otherwise
			   it will not

 CHECK_SUPPORTED - this phase is used to check whether a HW specific reset type
				   is supported. It's main use is for HW dependent modules which
				   do support a range of HW specific reset types. For this phase,
				   PCI_ERR_ENOTSUP should be returned for those types not defined.

 pci_server_state_e

 Internal server state

 Clients can register for notification of server state change events and the
 event data provided during notification will be the current and next state as
 identified by one of the following values (see also pci/pci_event.h)

 pci_server_state_e_INITIALIZING
 - this is currently a one time initial state in which the server executes prior
   to accepting messages from clients. As such this state is not available in
   notification events

 pci_server_state_e_RUNNING
 - this is the normal functioning state of the PCI server and the first state
   available in state notification events

 pci_server_state_e_IDLE
 - this state indicates that the PCI server is temporarily not accepting new
   message requests

 pci_server_state_e_EXITING
 - when the PCI server receives a request to terminate (either asynchronously
   via signal or synchronously through an API), it will first move to the EXITING
   state at which time all registered atexit() processing will be completed.
   See the 'use' information for any loaded server modules for what atexit()
   processing they do.
   During this time, the server will continue to process messages however no
   new device attach or event notification registration requests will be
   accepted. This state is intended to allow clients to cleanup and gracefully
   detach from the PCI server prior to server termination. The only allowed next
   state is pci_server_state_e_TERMINATING

 pci_server_state_e_TERMINATING
 - the PCI server executes _exit() in order to terminate the process. This is

 * Advanced Features capability and FLR as per the AF capabilities register) or
 * of a PCI bus segment/PCIe link (secondary bus reset) if the device resides on
 * a PCI-to-PCI bridge (or PCIe Root Port that reports as a PCI-to-PCI bridge).
 *
 * In all cases, the specific device to be reset or the bus/link on which the
 * device resides is identified by <hdl>.
 *
 * If the reset type is 'pci_resetType_e_BUS', all devices on the bus/link on
 * which the device identified by <hdl> resides and below will be reset. That
 * is, if <hdl> identifies a bridge device, then the reset will propagate to
 * each subordinate bus segment below the segment on which the bridge identified
 * by <hdl> resides.
 *
 * A device cannot be reset unless the caller is the owner of the device.
 *
 * Furthermore, the caller must be the only client attached to the device when
 * the reset call is made. It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure
 * this for multi-owned attaches to a single device or for the case of a bus
 * reset in which devices other than the device the caller is resetting are
 * affected. That is, all clients must be detached from devices that will be
 * reset as a consequence of a bus reset.
 *
 * On successful return, the device identified by <hdl> will have been reset and
 * re-configured to the D0 initialized state. Any driver software utilizing the
 * device must comprehend this condition and perform any required device
 * specific initialization that may have been lost as a result of the reset
 * operation including, but not limited to, restoring the bus master bit in the
 * command register of affected devices.
 *
 * A reset type of 'pci_resetType_e_RST' or 'pci_resetType_e_PERST' is similar
 * in behaviour to 'pci_resetType_e_BUS' and must therefore follow all of the
 * rules for that reset type. The primary difference is that because it is
 * platform specific what effect assertion of RST# and/or PERST# has, it is the
 * responsibility of the HW module to document what those effects are and also
 * document what device (BDF) the 'pci_devhdl_t' should represent in calls to
 * pci_device_reset(). For example, most PCI (not PCIe) platforms which support
 * assertion of RST# will have the assertion of that signal affect all PCI
 * devices including the Host Bridge. It is typical that the HW module for such
 * platforms will require that the 'pci_devhdl_t' be for the Host Bridge device
 * so that all devices are reconfigured
 *
 * ** Special considerations for reset type pci_resetType_e_SEGMENT **
 *
 * Because this reset type operates on the Root Port of a segment hierarchy,
 * this reset type is privileged when using certain server modules (ex. error
 * and event handling modules). The reason for this is because Root Ports are
 * also event reporting agents and when the event handling server modules are
 * used, they necessarily take ownership of these devices thereby preventing
 * other clients from attaching and hence obtaining the required 'pci_devhdl_t'
 * in order to use the reset API.
 * Utilities such as pci-tool are privileged in this regard
 * In all scenarios, if the HW module does not support this reset type, it will
 * not be possible to use it as also described above for 'pci_resetType_e'
 *
 * IMPORTANT
 *
 * Since this API can potentially impact multiple devices, the caller must be
 * sure of what they are doing. During the time that the reset is occurring,
 * configuration space accesses to the device(s) will be halted. There is
 * currently no in-band mechanism for preventing accesses to device specific
 * registers obtained from a successful call to pci_device_read_ba() and
 * mmap()'d by other driver software so it is the callers responsibility to
 * coordinate with such software as required.
 *
 * A future mechanism will be put in place to provide system designers with
 * client access controls to the reset API

                 PCI Server Connection and Disconnection

 Every process has one primary connection to the PCI server for the purpose of
 sending messages. Other connections are optionally established as required, for
 example to receive event notifications.

 In order to provide maximum flexibility, the PCI library implements several
 mechanisms for managing the connection and disconnection to the PCI server as
 described below

 Connection Initiation scenarios

 1. Client starts after pci-server (normal scenario)
	- if client calls to APIs which trigger a connection to the PCI server
	  (ex. pci_device_attach()) succeed, the connection is established otherwise
	  an error is returned from the connection attempt
	- on error, connection re-attempts will be driven by client API calls

 2. Client starts before pci-server
	- client calls to APIs which trigger a connection to the PCI server fail
	  with PCI_ERR_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE
	- once the PCI server becomes available, connection initiation proceeds as
	  in scenario #1

 Disconnection scenarios (client has a valid connection to the pci-server)

 Disconnection is described from the clients perspective and so we separate them
 into 2 classes, synchronous and asynchronous defined as follows

 1. Synchronous disconnect

	This type of disconnect is driven by the client. A typical use case is for
	a client which makes use of PCI	services by dynamically loading and
	unloading DLL's at runtime. An example is io-pkt and its PCI based devnp-*
	DLL's.
	When the DLL is unloaded, it can optionally choose to disconnect from the
	PCI Server on the last pci_device_detach() call. This is useful in
	situations where the client does not make use of server internal state
	change events and wants to ensure that when it reloads a DLL requiring PCI
	services (presumably at an unknown time in the future, likely driven by
	external and/or user activity), it will re-initiate a connection to the PCI
	server,	usually on the first pci_device_attach() call. Any restarts of the
	PCI server during the time that the client DLL was unloaded (and hence
	disconnected) will be transparent to the operation of the client itself.
	Synchronous disconnect is enabled with the pci_attachFlags_e_DETACH_DISCONNECT
	attach flag

	Synchronous Disconnection scenario

	a. Both the client and pci-server processes remain running normally
		- client calls pci_device_attach() with attach flag
		  pci_attachFlags_e_DETACH_DISCONNECT
		- at some point later in time, client calls pci_device_detach() for each
		  pci_device_attach() call
		- on the last pci_device_detach() call, the client will be disconnected
		  from the server
		- subsequent connection initiation attempts operate as described under
		  Connection Initiation

 2. Asynchronous disconnect

	This type of disconnect is driven by the server usually as a result of an
	internal state change to the EXITING or the TERMINATING state and is
	otherwise unexpected by clients.
	Within this class of disconnect, there are two forms

	- Coordinated asynchronous disconnect
	- Uncoordinated asynchronous disconnect

	Coordinated Asynchronous disconnect

	A coordinated asynchronous disconnect occurs when the PCI server is directed
	to the EXITING state where it will remain until directed to the TERMINATING
	state (see the definition of 'pci_server_state_e' above for state details).
	Upon entering the EXITING state, attached clients are notified of the event
	so that they can take appropriate action including, but not limited to,
	detaching from any attached devices.
	Notification can be implemented by having each client independently register
	for notification of internal state change events or by having a designated
	client (perhaps a shutdown manager) register for internal state change
	notifications and then notify other attached clients via a user defined
	mechanism. In both cases, registration for event notifications makes use of
	the APIs defined in pci/pci_event.h

	Coordinated Asynchronous Disconnection scenarios

	a. pci-server terminates, internal state change event notifications sent to
	   all clients

		- On reception of EXITING event
		  - call pci_device_detach() to gracefully detach from any attached devices
		  - clients invalidate local copies of their 'pci_devhdl_t' for all attached
			devices, free any 'pci_cap_t' resources and do whatever other cleanup
			is required
		  - client waits for TERMINATING event
		- On reception of TERMINATING event
		  - internal event handing will close the connection to the PCI server
		- Subsequent connection initiation attempts operate as described under
		  Connection Initiation

	b. pci-server terminates, internal state change event notification sent to
	   a designated client not attached to devices

		- On reception of EXITING event
		  - designated client must inform (in a user defined manner) any clients
			attached to any PCI devices that the server will be exiting
		  - until attached clients are informed, they will be able to continue
			to access their devices
		  - once informed, attached clients should detach from all attached
			devices, free any 'pci_cap_t' resources and do whatever other cleanup
			is required
		  - attached clients inform the designated client that they have completed
			detachment and cease to use any other libpci APIs
		- On reception of TERMINATING event
		  - user defined designated client processing (ex. optionally inform the
			(previously) attached clients that the server has terminated)
		  - It is user defined when clients begin to start using libpci APIs
			again
		- Subsequent connection initiation attempts operate as described under
		  Connection Initiation

	Uncoordinated Asynchronous disconnect

	An uncoordinated asynchronous disconnect occurs when the PCI server
	terminates (either normally or abnormally) and clients are unaware of the
	situation until attempts to communicate with the server (via libpci APIs)
	fail with PCI_ERR_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE

	Asynchronous Uncoordinated Disconnection scenario

	a. pci-server terminates (normally or abnormally)

		- all attached clients that use APIs which require sending a message
		  to the server will start receiving PCI_ERR_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE
		- attached clients should free any 'pci_cap_t' resources and do
		  whatever other internal cleanup is required
		- clients should cease to use any libpci APIs. It is user defined when
		  clients begin to start using libpci APIs again
		- Subsequent connection initiation attempts operate as described under
		  Connection Initiation


	In all cases of disconnect

	clients which receive the PCI_ERR_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE error ...
	- should cease calling libpci APIs (except for pci_device_detach() for
	  coordinated asynchronous disconnects on EXITING or pci_device_attach()
	  in the case of reconnection attempts)
	- are required to cease using the 'pci_devhdl_t' from all previously attached
	  devices
	- are required to free any 'pci_cap_t' resources. These must be re-read
	- prepare for reconnection. Connection initiation attempts operate as
	  described under Connection Initiation

	clients which receive an error other than PCI_ERR_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE must
	handle the error as described by the API and take appropriate action
