 PCI server event APIs

 The PCI library provides a set of event notification APIs that allow the
 caller to easily register a handler function to be called whenever the event
 of interest occurs. This mechanism eliminates the need for the caller to have
 to manage connections or otherwise worry about the details of event delivery
 and instead concentrate on the details of handling the event occurrence.

 The use of the event notification APIs requires at least one event processing
 server module to be loaded. See /etc/system/config/pci/pci_server-template.cfg
 for a description on how to load server modules.

 Below is the current list of events which are supported and the server module
 which provides the support. Note that some modules will handle more than one
 event and there may be more than one module which handles a given event

 1. device insertion and removal      - pci_server-event_handler.so
 2. link state change                 - pci_server-event_handler.so
 3. link bandwidth change             - pci_server-event_handler.so
 4. NTB specific events               - pci_server-ntb-*.so
 5. Internal server state change      - N/A (pci-server handles these events)
 6. Error events                      - pci_server-error_event_handler.so

 See also 'pci_event_type_e' below for more details on which events are
 currently supported, which server module provides that support and other
 details on the event delivery

 General Usage
 -------------
 In general, events of interest, and optionally their attributes, are
 established with the pci_event_create() API.

 This function will return a unique 'pci_event_t' which is then associated with
 the event and which can be used to register for notification of that specific
 event. Event creation is separate from and independent of event notification
 registration.

 In order to receive notification of specific events, events of interest
 (identified by their 'pci_event_t') are registered with the pci_event_reg()
 API. In addition to the event of interest, the caller provides the following
 additional information

	1 a registration identifier (pci_event_regid_t) which will identify the
	  entity for which occurrence of the specific event type should be
	  delivered
	2 a handler function to be called when the event occurs on the entity
	  identified by the 'pci_event_regid_t'
	3 an optional pointer to a 'pci_err_t' variable which will hold the reason
	  for event registration failure

 When the event occurs, the registered handler function will be called with
 event specific data of type 'pci_event_data_t'. See the description of
 'pci_event_data_t' below for the fields applicable to each event type.

 In addition, the 'pci_event_type_e' that was associated with the 'pci_event_t'
 at registration time is provided so that the same handler can be registered for
 multiple event types if desired.

 The 'pci_event_t'used when registering is also provided. This will allow the
 handler function to obtain any optional event attributes established at event
 creation time. One obvious use would be to retrieve the event specific
 attribute associated with the event (see pci_event_attr_set_specific()) which
 could be a pointer to a data area specifically related to the event or set of
 events.

 Once a user has registered an event, the 'pci_event_t' can be destroyed if it
 is no longer required. In all cases, once a 'pci_event_t' is no longer of
 interest it should be destroyed with pci_event_destroy()

 Event Attributes
 ----------------
 Prior to calling pci_event_create(), the user may optionally specify certain
 attributes of the event. Each attribute which may be specified has a
 pci_event_attr_set_*() and pci_event_attr_get_*() API. Similar to POSIX, this
 mechanism provides for an easily extendible list of event attributes while
 preserving existing APIs.
 An event attributes object can be initialized as an automatic or static variable
 or with the pci_event_attr_init() API

 Once a user has registered an event, the 'pci_event_attr_t' can be destroyed
 if it is no longer required. In all cases, once a 'pci_event_attr_t' is no
 longer of interest it should be destroyed with pci_event_attr_destroy()

 ** Important **
 Even if a 'pci_event_t' is destroyed after registration, the 'pci_event_t'
 passed to the handler function, as well as any of its attributes (obtainable
 with the pci_event_attr_get() API) will still be valid

 Event handling threads
 ----------------------
 By default, when the event registration API pci_event_reg() is called for the
 first time, an event handler thread is created on behalf of the process. The
 'pthread_t' for this thread can be obtained with the pci_event_get_thread_id()
 API. After the caller has unregistered all events, the event handler thread
 terminates.

 There are 4 APIs which allow users complete control over the processing of
 events (see below for usage details)

	pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr()
	pci_event_attr_get_thread_attr()
	pci_event_attr_set_thread_id()
	pci_event_get_thread_id()

 These APIs are optional and if not utilized, all event notifications will be
 handled by a single event handler thread created when the first event is
 successfully registered as previously described.
 The default event thread (named "pci_events") will be created with default
 thread attributes as per pthread_attr_init() however it will have the flag
 PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED set as per pthread_attr_setdetachstate(). This thread
 will terminate when the last event is unregistered.

 The user can change the name of an event thread with pthread_setname_np() and
 the 'pthread_t' returned from pci_event_get_thread_id()

 If the user wishes for the event handling thread to have non default thread
 attributes, the following sequence can be used

	pci_event_attr_t event_attr;
	pthread_attr_t thread_attr;

	pci_event_attr_init(&event_attr);
	pthread_attr_init(&thread_attr);

	set the desired thread attributes of the event handling thread
	pthread_attr_set*(&thread_attr, ...);
	pthread_attr_set*(&thread_attr, ...);
	pthread_attr_set*(&thread_attr, ...);

	pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr(&event_attr, &thread_attr);
	pci_event_create(event_type, event_attr);

 Assuming pci_event_create() is successful, the 'pci_event_t' returned can be
 registered for event notification. If registration is successful, an event
 handling thread will be created with the thread attributes established above.

 It is important to note that if another event is created with pci_event_create()
 using the same 'event_attr' above, then when that event is successfully
 registered, another separate event handling thread will be created for that
 event. This is because the 'pci_event_attr_t' being used when the event is
 created, has had pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr() called on it. If the user
 simply wishes to have subsequent events associated with the same event handling
 thread that was created when the first event was registered, then one of three
 options are available

	1. call pci_event_create() with the 'pci_event_attr_t' argument set to NULL
	2. call pci_event_create() with a 'pci_event_attr_t' argument which has not
	   had pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr() called on it or which has had the
	   'pthread_attr_t' canceled (see pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr())
	3. call pci_event_create() with a 'pci_event_attr_t' argument which has had
	   pci_event_attr_set_thread_id() called on it using the 'pthread_t'
	   returned from a successful call to pci_event_get_thread_id() using the
	   'pci_evthdl_t' returned from the registration of the first event

 Associating events with a specific event handling thread (assuming there is more
 than one) is accomplished similar to the above however all except the first
 event registered should use a separate 'pci_event_attr_t' which has had
 pci_event_attr_set_thread_id() called on it

 For example

	pci_event_attr_t event_attr_first;
	pci_event_attr_t event_attr_remaining;
	pthread_attr_t thread_attr;

	pci_event_attr_init(&event_attr_first);
	pci_event_attr_init(&event_attr_remaining);
	pthread_attr_init(&thread_attr);

	set the desired thread attributes of the first event handling thread
	pthread_attr_set*(&thread_attr, ...);
	pthread_attr_set*(&thread_attr, ...);
	pthread_attr_set*(&thread_attr, ...);

	associate the event thread attributes with 'event_attr_first' and create
	the event
	pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr(&event_attr_first, &thread_attr);
	pci_event_t event_1 = pci_event_create(event_type, event_attr_first);

	register the event, creating the event handling thread
	pci_evthdl_t evthdl_1 = pci_event_reg(..., event_1, ..., ...);
	pthread_t event_thread_1 = pci_event_get_thread_id(evthdl_1);

	associate 'event_attr_remaining' with 'event_thread_1'
	pci_event_attr_set_thread_id(&event_attr_remaining, event_thread_1);

	create and register all remaining events to be associated with 'event_thread_1'
	pci_event_t event_2 = pci_event_create(event_type, event_attr_remaining);
	pci_evthdl_t evthdl_2 = pci_event_reg(..., event_2, ..., ...);
	pci_event_t event_3 = pci_event_create(event_type, event_attr_remaining);
	pci_evthdl_t evthdl_3 = pci_event_reg(..., event_3, ..., ...);
	pci_event_t event_4 = pci_event_create(event_type, event_attr_remaining);
	pci_evthdl_t evthdl_4 = pci_event_reg(..., event_4, ..., ...);

	... etc ...

 This sequence can be repeated as many times as required in order to register
 the events of interest and have them associated with specific event handling
 threads

 The set function allows the caller to indicate that a separate event handling
 thread should be spawned for any registered 'pci_event_t' associated with
 <event_attr> and that the spawned thread should be created with attributes as
 specified by <thread_attr>.

 The POSIX pthread_attr_*() functions can be used to establish <thread_attr>.
 The caller is responsible for destroying the 'pthread_attr_t' object when it
 has finished with it. This can be done after calling
 pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr() if desired

 Note that in order to set the scheduling parameters of a thread using the
 attributes object, the PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED flag should be set.
 See pthread_attr_setinheritsched() for details.
 Also, if you wish the thread to terminate itself after the last event using
 that thread unregisters, make sure to set the PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED flag.
 See pthread_attr_setdetachstate() for details

 The set function is mutually exclusive to pci_event_attr_set_thread_id() and if
 called on a 'pci_event_attr_t' object which has already been associated with
 another event handling thread with pci_event_attr_set_thread_id() or is already
 associated with a 'pthread_attr_t', will return PCI_ERR_EALREADY

 If <thread_attr> is NULL, any previously associated 'pthread_attr_t' will be
 dissociated from <event_attr>. This is effectively a cancellation of any
 previous pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr() call with a non-NULL <thread_attr>.
 Note however that the caller is still responsible for destroying the
 'pthread_attr_t'
 If NULL is provided and no association exists but pci_event_attr_set_thread_id()
 has been called on <event_attr>, PCI_ERR_EINVAL will be returned

 The get function allows the caller to retrieve the 'pthread_attr_t' currently
 associated with the 'pci_event_attr_t'. It will return PCI_ERR_ENOENT if no
 'pthread_attr_t' is associated with <event_attr>.

 On success, the 'pthread_attr_t' returned will be a copy of the 'pthread_attr_t'
 provided at the time of the last successful pci_event_attr_set_thread_attr()
 call. The caller is free to use the pthread_attr_set*() APIs on the returned
 'pthread_attr_t' object however in order for the updated settings to take
 effect when the event is created, the caller must cancel the current association
 and establish a new one with the updated settings similar to the following
 procedure

	pthread_attr_t attr;
	pci_err_t r = pci_event_attr_get_thread_attr(event_attr, &attr);
	if (r == PCI_ERR_OK)
	{
		pthread_attr_set*(&attr, ...);

 handled by which event handling threads.

 associated with can be optionally controlled with the attribute setting APIs
 described above and/or the POSIX pthread_*() APIs.

 This function will provide the caller with the 'pthread_t' of the thread a
 particular event is associated with allowing complete control over things such

 to be associated with an existing event handling thread by using the
 pci_event_attr_set_thread_id() API.
