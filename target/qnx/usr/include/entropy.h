/**
 * Prototype for function to be used by library entropy sources to add entropy to random.  While
 * the quality and size of the entropy being added is largely arbitrary, large volumes of low
 * quality entropy should not be added directly but rather hashed using a cryptographic hash
 * and the resultant hash added instead.
 *
 * The first call to this function is guaranteed to be used as part of the initial seeding of
 * the PRNG and thus may be used to ensure the quality of data provided by random on startup.
 *
 * This function must be called within 5 seconds of random_source_init being called to avoid a
 * startup failure of random.  If entropy is not immediately available, one may make a call with a
 * size of zero.  In all cases the initial call to random_add_entropy_fn should be delayed until the
 * library has completed all privileged operations that are needed only during start-up.
 *
 * This function is thread safe.
 *
 * @param id        Identifier for entropy source.  This must be the value passed to random_source_init.
 * @param buffer    Pointer to buffer containing entropy to be added.  This may be NULL if size
 *                  is zero.
 * @param size      Size of buffer in bytes

 * Prototype for library entropy source initialization function.  To use the new random entropy
 * library interface a dll must export a function with this signature called "random_source_init".
 * It is the first, and possibly only function called in the entropy dll.
 *
 * As this function must return, the library is expected to create its own thread for adding
 * entropy.
 *
 * @param id        Identifier for entropy source.  This must be provided when adding entropy.
 * @param paddfn    Function for library to call to add entropy.  This is expected to be called
 *                  periodically and must be called within 5s of random_source_init being called .
 * @param context   A pointer to a character string providing options for the dll.  Options may
 *                  be provided by following the library name with ':option-string' when using
 *                  random's -l option.  If no option string was provided, this is an empty
 *                  string.
